    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> My name is Kaden Fedele and I am a senior at Clovis High School. I like to play and watch sports, with basketball/football being my two favorites. I'm attending Texas Christian University for college in pursuit of becoming a sports statistician. I've always loved sports and wish to stay close to them in whatever career path I take later in life. My favorite football team is and always has been the Raiders, despite all the hardships the team likes to put on themselves I still enjoy watching them play every week during their season.
        - I am the second youngest out of 4 kids
    - I have an older brother, older sister, and little sister
    - I enjoy playing video games and chess in my free time and have taken an interest in learning how to play Texas Hold'em </p>
